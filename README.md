# STM32 Workspace

This repository contains a collection of mini projects developed for STM32 microcontrollers. The projects are organized into two main categories: HAL-based projects and LL-based projects.

## HAL-Based Projects

The Hardware Abstraction Layer (HAL) is a high-level library provided by STMicroelectronics to abstract the hardware details and simplify the development process.

### Projects List

1. **LED Toggle:** Simple project to toggle an LED.
2. **Button Interrupt:** Handling button press using interrupts.
3. **UART Communication:** Basic UART communication.
   ...
16. **Advanced Project 1:** Description of the advanced project.
17. **Advanced Project 2:** Another advanced project.

## LL-Based Projects

The Low-Level (LL) library provides a lower-level interface compared to the HAL and gives more direct access to the hardware.

### Projects List

1. **LL LED Toggle:** LED toggle using LL library.
2. **LL Timer Configuration:** Configuring timers using LL.
3. **LL SPI Communication:** SPI communication with LL.
   ...
11. **Advanced LL Project 1:** Description of an advanced LL project.
12. **Advanced LL Project 2:** Another advanced LL project.

## Usage

You can navigate to each project's folder for detailed instructions and source code.

Feel free to explore and use these projects as a reference for STM32 development. If you have any questions or improvements, don't hesitate to open an issue or contribute.

Happy coding!
