### State Table Implementation:

1. **Define State and Event Enumerations:**
   - Define enumerations for states and events (`State` and `Event`).
   - Ensure that the enumerations end with special constants (`MAX_STATE` and `MAX_SIG`) to track changes dynamically.

2. **Initialize the State Table:**
   - Define a two-dimensional array named `TimeBomb_table` to hold the state table.
   - Use the states and events enumerations to dimension the array.
   - Fill in the array with action function pointers corresponding to state-event combinations.
   - Use special actions like `TimeBomb_ignore` for unhandled events.

3. **Define Action Functions:**
   - Implement action functions for each state-event combination.
   - These functions perform necessary actions and may trigger state transitions.
   - Ensure each function conforms to the `TimeBombAction` function pointer type.

4. **Dispatch Function:**
   - Implement a dispatch function (`TimeBomb_dispatch`) to handle events and state transitions.
   - Index into the state table using the current state and the incoming event.
   - Call the corresponding action function based on the state-event combination.

### Entry/Exit Actions:

1. **Define Entry/Exit Actions for States:**
   - Identify actions that should occur upon entering or exiting each state.
   - Implement entry and exit action functions for each state.

2. **Update Action Functions:**
   - Move repeated actions from transitions to entry and exit actions of corresponding states.
   - Ensure that entry actions are executed upon entering a state, and exit actions are executed upon exiting a state.

3. **Modify Dispatch Function:**
   - Call entry and exit actions appropriately based on state transitions.
   - Ensure that these actions are invoked before and after executing transition actions.

### Status Return Type:

1. **Define Status Return Type:**
   - Introduce an enumerated type (`Status`) to represent the status of action functions.
   - Include statuses like `TRAN_STATUS`, `HANDLED_STATUS`, `IGNORED_STATUS`, and `INIT_STATUS`.

2. **Modify Action Functions:**
   - Update action functions to return the appropriate status.
   - Differentiate between transitions, handled actions, ignored events, and initial transitions.

3. **Update Dispatch Function:**
   - Check the status returned by action functions to handle transitions and actions accordingly.


The state table implementation allows for a structured representation of the state machine, making it easier to visualize and manage states and transitions. Entry and exit actions enhance modularity and maintainability by encapsulating state-specific behaviors. Additionally, introducing a status return type adds clarity and facilitates error handling within the state machine implementation.
