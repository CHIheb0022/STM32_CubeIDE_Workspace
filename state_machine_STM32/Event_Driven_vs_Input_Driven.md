| Aspect                  | Event-Driven State Machine                              | Input-Driven State Machine                             |
|-------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| Handling Events         | Events trigger state transitions.                       | Directly reacts to changes in input signals.           |
| State Transition        | Transitions are triggered by specific events.           | Transitions are triggered by changes in input signals. |
| Event Processing        | Events are dispatched to the state machine.             | Input signals are directly processed by the state machine. |
| Implementation Complexity | May require additional event handling logic.           | Simplified handling as there are no explicit events.   |
| Use Cases               | Suitable for systems with asynchronous events.          | Suitable for systems with frequent and immediate input changes. |
| Example Provided        | Button presses trigger LED state changes.               | Button presses directly control LED state changes.     |
