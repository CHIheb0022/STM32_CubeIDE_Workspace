# State Machines Implementation

## 1. Defining the State Table:
- Represent the state table as a two-dimensional array in C.
- Define constants for the maximum number of states (`MAX_STATE`) and the maximum number of event signals (`MAX_SIG`).
- Initialize the state table with function pointers to action functions. Each cell in the array corresponds to a state-event combination, and the function pointer represents the action to be performed.

## 2. Implementing Action Functions:
- Define action functions for each state and event combination. These functions execute the required actions based on the current state and the incoming event.
- Entry and exit actions are implemented as separate functions associated with states. These functions perform actions upon entering or exiting a state.

## 3. Initializing the State Table:
- Initialize the state table with function pointers corresponding to each state-event combination. Use the appropriate action functions for each cell in the table.
- Ensure that the table is constant to prevent modifications at runtime and to optimize memory usage.

## 4. Dispatching Events:
- In the dispatch function, index into the state table using the current state and the incoming event signal.
- Call the corresponding action function based on the state-event combination.
- Check the return status of the action function to determine if a transition occurred.
- If a transition occurred, call the exit action for the previous state and the entry action for the new state.
- Ensure that the state transitions are handled correctly, including the initial transition.

## 5. Handling Entry and Exit Actions:
- Define entry and exit action functions for each state.
- Move repeated actions from transitions to the entry and exit actions of the corresponding states.
- Ensure that entry actions are executed upon entering a state, and exit actions are executed upon exiting a state.
- Update the dispatch function to call entry and exit actions appropriately based on state transitions.

## 6. Returning Status from Action Functions:
- Modify action functions to return status information indicating whether a transition occurred, an action was handled, or an event was ignored.
- Update the dispatch function to handle the returned status and perform actions accordingly.

## 7. Building and Testing:
- Build the code and load it onto the target board.
- Test the state machine behavior to ensure that transitions and actions are executed correctly.

# Guard Conditions

To implement guard conditions in your state machine, you'll need to follow these steps:

1. **Identify Decision Points**: Determine where in your state machine logic you need to make decisions based on runtime conditions.

2. **Define Guard Conditions**: For each decision point, define the guard conditions, which are boolean expressions evaluated at runtime. These conditions determine which transition should be taken.

3. **Add Choice Pseudostates**: Add choice pseudostates to your state machine diagram at the decision points. Choice pseudostates are depicted as diamonds and represent decision points.

4. **Label Transitions with Guards**: Outgoing transitions from choice pseudostates should be labeled with the guard conditions in square brackets. Each transition's guard condition determines whether that transition is enabled or disabled.

5. **Implement Guard Conditions in Code**: In your code, implement the guard conditions using conditional statements (if-else). Evaluate the guard conditions at runtime to decide which transition to take.

6. **Handle Complementary Guards**: If necessary, handle complementary guards to cover all possible conditions. These guards typically correspond to an "else" condition in your code.
