# Overview

In the following examples, I have explored various concepts related to Real-Time Operating Systems (RTOS) and specifically FreeRTOS. These examples are implemented on STM32 microcontrollers.

## Introduction

The code projects cover fundamental concepts of RTOS and FreeRTOS and demonstrate their application on STM32 devices. Each oedelves into different aspects of task management, inter-task communication, synchronization mechanisms, and more.

## Topics

1. **Task Operations (RTOS2.0_TASKS folder):**
   - Overview: Introduces the basics of task creation, switching between tasks, suspending, resuming, and terminating tasks.
   - Implementation: Demonstrates task creation, switching, suspension, resumption, and termination on STM32 using FreeRTOS.

2. **Using Queue (FreeRTOS_QUEUE folder):**
   - Overview: Explores the usage of queues for inter-task communication.
   - Implementation: Shows how to create and utilize queues for data exchange between tasks on STM32 with FreeRTOS.

3. **Tasks and Priorities (RTOS-1 folder):**
   - Overview: Covers task priorities and scheduling in RTOS.
   - Implementation: Demonstrates task prioritization and scheduling techniques on STM32 with FreeRTOS.

## Learning Objectives

I aimed to cover the following major concepts in RTOS and FreeRTOS:

- Task management and scheduling
- Inter-task communication using queues
- Task synchronization and coordination
- Resource sharing and protection
- Real-time constraints and deadlines

## Conclusion

By working through these examples, I gained practical insights into designing and implementing real-time embedded systems using FreeRTOS on STM32 microcontrollers. These tutorials serve as a foundation for understanding and applying RTOS principles in embedded software development.
